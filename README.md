# Pyrex

This is a way to work on things in Jupyter notebooks using both Python and R. Provides a base image with jupyter and some common installs for Python and R.

Pyrex:
- "Py" for Python
- "r" for R
- "ex" for...executable? I dunno, I thought it was clever

Use a Pyrex version to suit your needs!

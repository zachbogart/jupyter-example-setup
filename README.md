# pyrex

![](measuring_cup.png)

`pyrex` is a way to work on things in Jupyter notebooks using both Python and R, all inside a reproducible docker container. Provides different docker containers with jupyter and some common installs for Python and R.

- This repo is connected to [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zachbogart/pyrex)

## Overview
Below is a list of "pyrex containers", which are base docker containers available through DockerHub. They include Python and R, along with different combinations of installed packages for each.

# Pyrex Containers

| Container | Usage | Dockerfile | Python | R | Description
| :---: | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| [vanilla](https://github.com/zachbogart/pyrex/tree/main/vanilla/) | `FROM zachbogart/pyrex:vanilla` | [Dockerfile](https://github.com/zachbogart/pyrex/tree/main/vanilla/Dockerfile) | [Pipfile](https://github.com/zachbogart/pyrex/tree/main/vanilla/Pipfile) | [RScript](https://github.com/zachbogart/pyrex/tree/main/vanilla/install_packages.R) | The basics for Python (np, pd, plt) and R (tidyverse, readxl, glue). 
| [vanilla_swirl](https://github.com/zachbogart/pyrex/tree/main/vanilla_swirl) | `FROM zachbogart/pyrex:vanilla_swirl` | [Dockerfile](https://github.com/zachbogart/pyrex/tree/main/vanilla_swirl/Dockerfile) | [Pipfile](https://github.com/zachbogart/pyrex/tree/main/vanilla_swirl/Pipfile) | [RScript](https://github.com/zachbogart/pyrex/tree/main/vanilla_swirl/install_packages.R) | Copy of `vanilla` with selected nbextentions pre-installed (see bottom of Dockerfile).

## In the Wild (How do I get started?)
- Learn by doing! See [zachbogart/pyrex-usage-example](https://github.com/zachbogart/pyrex-usage-example) for an example project that uses a pyrex container to work with some data in either Python or R, and saves some simple results.
- You can also `docker pull` manually off of [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/zachbogart/pyrex)

## Installing Packages While Running Jupyter in Docker Container
The pyrex containers may be missing some package you really crave. It's easy to install them while running a jupyter notebook. You can execute these in a cell:

Python: 
```
pip3 install <MODULE_NAME>
```

R:
```
install.packages("<PACKAGE_NAME>")
```

- Note: since installs are inside docker, they will be ephemeral and will have to be reinstalled when you rerun a container.

## Why pyrex?

Pyrex:
- "Py" for Python
- "r" for R
- "ex" for...executable? I dunno, I thought it was clever
